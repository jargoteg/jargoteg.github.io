I joined the Natural Robotics Lab at The University of Sheffield in January 2022. I received an MSc degree in Robotics from The University of Sheffield and a BSc in Electromechanical Engineering from the Technological University of Panama. My research focuses on enhancing the performance of robotic swarms by using predicted information from models of the robots. The approach taken uses decentralized predictive control algorithms to model desired behaviors.
